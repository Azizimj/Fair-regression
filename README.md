# Fair-regression
# Regression in MATLAB with fairness accountability

There are three types of accounting for fairness in machine learning: 

1- Pre-processing approaches, e.g. ["Data preprocessing techniques for classification without discrimination"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10115-011-0463-8) by Kamiran et al. 2012.

2- In-processing approaches, e.g. ["A Convex Framework for Fair Regression"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02409) by Berk et al. 2017.

3- Post-processing approaches, e.g. ["Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning"](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6374-equality-of-opportunity-in-supervised-learning.pdf) by Hardt et al. 2016.

To read about Fairness in Machine learning you can refer to [FATML](https://www.fatml.org/) conference page and papers.

Here a MATLAB module for fair regression learning is provided which is a in-processing approach and uses the fairness penalty concept in the paper by Berk et al. 2017.
